# Introduction

The `arcpyr` package provides a simple interface to `arcpy` for R 
users. The interface should be straightforward to those who have
dabbled with Python and the `arcpy` module, or to those who have
done some basic work with ArcGIS Model Builder. If you don't fall
into either of those categories, don't worry! This vignette will 
show you the basics.

# Connecting to ArcGIS
